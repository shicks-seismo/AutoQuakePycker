Tried using polarisation analysis as well (e.g. Ross et al. and Bailard et al.)
- P and S filters and Dip-Rectilinearity value but did not produce consistent
results - bad polarisations - bad rotations - noisy data???
These sections have been commented out.

Found that separate filters are needed for P and S-waves
Added integration for S-wave picking

Final refinement takes S-picks on the T-component only to ensure that S is not
mispicked as Sp precursors.
Also computes magnitudes.
TODO: Consider picking on radial as well as transverse? (Preferentially select tranverse)
TODO: Check memory usage - are some variables being appended to?
TODO: Process TRN events
TODO: 8/11 Discovered some duplicates with Lidong's catalog (auto origin time
from lassie was too far off to be detected
TODO: Implement Sippl approach: If RMS too high, progressively remove picks with largest 
residuals until suitable RMS is found
TODO: On first step, only use stations that are closest, then incorporate more distant 
arrivals in later iteration. Do this 1 pick at a time if after relocation the single residual
of the new pick fell below a distance‐dependent goal residual (P:0.6 s + (traveltime)*0.015);
(S: 1.0 s + (traveltime)*0.015
